#For myshrc I assumed that no one will input myshrc function with & i.e. background process, I had to rtradoff betweeen handlinfg ; in handle input rather than execute function and handling & in Input.

All Assumption and Inputs, I have no time to explain File Structuires in detail, so One can consider everything loads in main and it passes input top Input.c, it tokenise and bifircate into Background process and Foreground Process and send it to execution.c which transalates what to do and send it to desiored dundtion or system calls, updating many thing in process.

Spec1,Spec2,Spec3,Spec4,Spec5  are satisfied completely
In Spec6 Somehow, My Background Function is not working as it, I might try to fix

Spec7 and Spec8 are working, even optional argument works

Spec10 I/O redirection is working, with proper syntax, I can just replace strcmp to strchr for all syntax, but I do not want to change because It might ruin it.
